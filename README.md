# Hit counter with KV Store on Fastly Compute

This starter kit sets up a basic page hit counter for a website using a KV Store in a Fastly Compute app in JavaScript.

* The app uses a default backend `glitchdotcom.github.io` with the sample site at `/my-site/`: [glitchdotcom.github.io/my-site/](https://glitchdotcom.github.io/my-site/)
  * The sample site is a clone of the Eleventy base blog
* The app uses [Expressly](https://expressly.edgecompute.app/) for routing requests
* We create a KV Store named `pagehits` on first run – it's listed in the `fastly.toml` file along with the backend
* Each page request increments the number of hits in the store
* The `/stats` page returns a list of the pages and their hits

You can use this starter kit out of the box with the default backend, or you can use your own website by changing it in the `fastly.toml` section `[setup.backends.blog]` __before you deploy the app for the first time__ (otherwise you need to update the backend address via the Fastly CLI)

# Default Starter Kit for Expressly

[![Deploy to Fastly](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/button)](https://deploy.edgecompute.app/deploy)

Expressly is a lightweight and minimalist routing layer for JavaScript apps running on Fastly Compute. Get to know the Compute environment with a basic expressly starter that demonstrates routing and middleware. To learn more about expressly, check out our [blog post](https://www.fastly.com/blog/write-less-do-more-at-the-edge-introducing-expressly) and visit our [documentation](https://expressly.edgecompute.app/).

**For more details about other starter kits for Fastly Compute, see the [Fastly developer hub](https://developer.fastly.com/solutions/starters)**

## Understanding the code

This starter is intentionally lightweight, and only requires the [`@fastly/js-compute`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastly/js-compute) and [`@fastly/expressly`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastly/expressly) npm packages. 

The starter doesn't require the use of any backends. Once deployed, you will have a Fastly service running on Compute that can generate synthetic responses at the edge.

## Running the application

To create an application using this starter kit, create a new directory for your application and switch to it, and then type the following command:

```shell
npm create @fastly/compute@latest -- --language=javascript --starter-kit=expressly
```

To build and run your new application in the local development environment, type the following command:

```shell
npm run start
```

To build and deploy your application to your Fastly account, type the following command. The first time you deploy the application, you will be prompted to create a new service in your account.

```shell
npm run deploy
```
